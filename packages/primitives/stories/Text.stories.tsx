              We can't bust heads like we used to. But we have our ways. One
              trick is to tell stories that don't go anywhere. Like the time I
              caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for m'shoe.
              So I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called
              Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt. Which
              was the style at the time.
